 * We want to use quad trees to store an N x N boolean grid. Each cell in the
 * grid can only be true or false. The root node represents the whole grid. For
 * each node, it will be subdivided into four children nodes until the values
 * in the region it represents are all the same.
 * 
 * Each node has another two boolean attributes : isLeaf and val. isLeaf is
 * true if and only if the node is a leaf node. The val attribute for a leaf
 * node contains the value of the region it represents.
 * 
 * Your task is to use a quad tree to represent a given grid. The following
 * example may help you understand the problem better:
 * 
 * Given the 8 x 8 grid below, we want to construct the corresponding quad
 * tree:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * It can be divided according to the definition above:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The corresponding quad tree should be as following, where each node is
 * represented as a (isLeaf, val) pair.
 * 
 * For the non-leaf nodes, val can be arbitrary, so it is represented as *.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * N is less than 1000 and guaranteened to be a power of 2.
 * If you want to know more about the quad tree, you can refer to its wiki.
